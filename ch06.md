# Chapter 06: Example Application

## Declarative Coding

From here on out, we stop telling the computer how to do its job and instead write a specification of what we’d like as a result. Declarative coding means writing expressions rather than explicit step‐by‐step instructions. Consider these examples.

Below is an imperative example in PowerShell for retrieving car makes:

```powershell
# Imperative: explicitly instantiating an array and then looping.
$cars = @(
    @{ make = 'Ford'; model = 'F-150' },
    @{ make = 'Toyota'; model = 'Camry' },
    @{ make = 'Honda'; model = 'Civic' }
)
$makes = @()
foreach ($car in $cars) {
    $makes += $car.make
}
```

And a declarative version:

```powershell
# Declarative: using the pipeline and ForEach-Object.
$makes = $cars | ForEach-Object { $_.make }
```

Notice that the pipeline expression specifies *what* we want (each car’s make) without managing loop counters or array instantiation.

Here’s another example—an authentication function.
The imperative version:

```powershell
# Imperative
function Authenticate {
    param($form)
    $user = ToUser $form
    return LogIn $user
}
```

A more declarative, composed version expresses authentication as the composition of converting a form to a user and then logging in that user. Assume you’ve defined a helper `Compose` (as in Chapter 05):

```powershell
# Declarative composition using a helper Compose function.
$Authenticate = Compose -Functions @({ LogIn $_ }, { ToUser $_ })
```

This declares that authentication equals _log in_ after _toUser_ —leaving room for optimizations and even parallel execution (as pure functions are naturally concurrent).

## A Flicker of Functional Programming

We’ll now build a small, declarative “Flickr App” that retrieves public images for a given tag (say, 'cats') and renders them (by producing an HTML file). We begin by isolating impure actions from our pure, composable code.

### Impure Actions

We define a namespace of functions for side effects. For example, an impure JSON getter (using PowerShell’s `Invoke-RestMethod`), a simple HTML setter (that writes to a file), and a trace helper for debugging. We also “curry” our impure functions to favor a data-last style.

```powershell
# Impure: wrap side-effect functions.
function Get-JSON {
    param(
        [ScriptBlock]$Callback,
        [string]$Url
    )
    # Call the API and pass the parsed JSON to the callback.
    $result = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $Url -Method Get
    & $Callback $result
}

function Set-HTML {
    param(
        [string]$Selector,  # Ignored in this example.
        [string]$Html
    )
    # Write out HTML to a file.
    Set-Content -Path "output.html" -Value $Html
    Write-Host "HTML written to output.html"
}

function Trace {
    param(
        [string]$Tag,
        $Value
    )
    Write-Host "$Tag: $Value"
    return $Value
}
```

### Constructing Our Flickr URL

We build the URL from parts. (Note that for simplicity we assume the Flickr API returns pure JSON.)

```powershell
$host = 'api.flickr.com'
$path = '/services/feeds/photos_public.gne'
$query = { param($tag) return "?tags=$tag&format=json" }
$url = { param($tag) return "https://$host$path$($query.Invoke($tag))" }
```

### Transforming JSON into Images

Flickr’s JSON feed contains an `items` array. Each item has a nested property `media` whose key `m` is the image URL. We write a universal getter and then use composition (again, assuming helpers like `Compose` from Chapter 05):

```powershell
# Universal getter for an object property.
function Get-Prop {
    param(
        [string]$Property,
        $Object
    )
    return $Object."$Property"
}

# Define a curried getter (for composability).
$Prop = { param($p, $o) Get-Prop -Property $p -Object $o }

# Extract the media URL: first get the 'media' property, then its 'm' subproperty.
$mediaUrl = Compose2 -f { param($x) & $Prop 'm' $x } -g { param($x) & $Prop 'media' $x }

# Compose a function that maps over items to retrieve the image URLs.
$mediaUrls = { param($json) $json.items | ForEach-Object { & $mediaUrl $_ } }
```

### Rendering the Images

To display the images, we build a simple HTML snippet. Here we create an `<img>` tag for each media URL and then set the output of a container element.

```powershell
# Transform a media URL into an HTML image tag.
function Img {
    param([string]$Src)
    return "<img src='$Src' />"
}

# Compose a function to create image tags from the media URLs.
$mediaToImg = { param($url) Img -Src $url }

$images = { param($json) ($json.items | ForEach-Object { 
    & $mediaToImg (& $mediaUrl $_) 
}) -join "`n" }

# Render: create HTML and invoke Set-HTML.
$render = Compose2 -f { param($imgs) Set-HTML -Selector "#js-main" -Html $imgs } -g $images
```

### Composing the App

Finally, we build an app function that ties everything together. It constructs the URL, retrieves JSON, then renders the images.

```powershell
$app = {
    param($tag)
    $flickrUrl = & $url $tag
    # Get JSON and then render.
    Get-JSON -Callback $render -Url $flickrUrl
}

# Launch the app for the 'cats' tag.
$app 'cats'
```

### A Principled Refactor

We could optimize our mapping operations. For instance, notice that we map over `items` twice to turn each item into a media URL and then into an image tag. By composing these maps, we can combine the two steps into one:

```powershell
# Instead of:
#   $mediaUrls = { $json.items | ForEach-Object { & $mediaUrl $_ } }
#   $images = { $json.items | ForEach-Object { & $mediaToImg (& $mediaUrl $_) } }
#
# We can define:
$mediaToImgCombined = Compose2 -f { param($imgUrl) Img -Src $imgUrl } -g $mediaUrl
$images = { param($json) ($json.items | ForEach-Object { & $mediaToImgCombined $_ }) -join "`n" }
```

This change reduces the number of iterations, using the composition law:
  map(f) ∘ map(g) ≡ map(compose(f, g)).

## In Summary

We have built a small declarative application in PowerShell that:

1. Constructs a URL based on a search term
2. Makes a JSON API call via `Invoke-RestMethod`
3. Transforms the JSON into HTML image tags using function composition
4. Renders the result to an HTML file

Each step is expressed as a high-level specification with minimal side effects. By isolating impure actions (like web requests and writing to the file system), our application can be reasoned about using declarative, composable functions—a style that is more maintainable, parallelizable, and robust.

Next up, we’ll explore how to further refine our code with error handling and additional functional techniques.
