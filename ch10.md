# Chapter 10: Applicative Functors

## Applying Applicatives

The term **applicative functor** hints at its ability to apply functions that are wrapped (or "bottled") inside a functor to values that are similarly wrapped. In our functional style, we already learned to inject values into containers via an `of` method and transform them with `Map`. Now we add an `ap` method that takes a functor holding a function and applies it to a functor holding a value.

For example, imagine we have a container that holds a partially applied addition function. In PowerShell using our `Container` type from Chapter 08, we could write:

```powershell
# Assume we have an add function that is curried.
function Add ($x) { 
    return { param($y) $x + $y }
}

# Using our Container type (from Chapter 08), we can simulate mapping a curried function:
# Container.of(Add(2)) holds a function that adds 2
# We then apply it to Container.of(3) to get a Container holding 5.

# First, define 'ap' for our Container.
class Container {
    [object]$Value
    Container([object]$x) { $this.Value = $x }
    
    static [Container] of([object]$x) {
        return [Container]::new($x)
    }
    
    [Container] Map([ScriptBlock]$f) {
        # Apply the function to the contained value and wrap the result.
        return [Container]::of(& $f $this.Value)
    }

    # 'ap' applies a container holding a function to another container.
    [Container] ap([Container]$other) {
        # Here, $this.Value is expected to be a function.
        return $other.Map({ param($x) & $this.Value $x })
    }
    
    [string] ToString() {
        return "Container($($this.Value))"
    }
}

# Usage examples:
# Partially apply add using Container.of:
$containerAdd2 = [Container]::of(Add 2)
# Now apply it to Container.of(3):
$result = $containerAdd2.ap([Container]::of(3))
Write-Output $result
# Expected output: Container(5)

# Alternatively, we can combine map and ap. Notice that since Add is curried,
# we can also write:
$result2 = [Container]::of(2).Map({ param($a) Add $a }).ap([Container]::of(3))
Write-Output $result2
# Again we get Container(5)
```

The idea is that using `ap` we can apply a container holding a function (like a partially applied add) onto another container holding a value—all without ever unwrapping them from their containers.

## A Generic Lift Function

Since applicatives allow us to apply multi-argument functions to several functor-wrapped values, we often define helper functions like `liftA2` and `liftA3` to “lift” normal functions into our container world. For example:

```powershell
# liftA2 takes a binary function (g) and two functors (f1 and f2), and returns the result.
function liftA2 {
    param(
        [ScriptBlock]$g,
        $f1,
        $f2
    )
    # f1.Map(g) produces a container holding a partially applied function.
    # Then ap applies f2's value.
    return ($f1.Map($g)).ap($f2)
}

# liftA3 works similarly for a function of three arguments.
function liftA3 {
    param(
        [ScriptBlock]$g,
        $f1,
        $f2,
        $f3
    )
    return (($f1.Map($g)).ap($f2)).ap($f3)
}

# Example usage with our Container:
# Define an add function that takes two arguments (curried).
function Add2 ($x) { return { param($y) $x + $y } }
# Using liftA2 to add two container values:
$resultLift = liftA2 { param($a, $b) $a + $b } ([Container]::of(2)) ([Container]::of(3))
Write-Output $resultLift
# Expected: Container(5)
```

These helper functions let you write your applicative code in a left-to-right style without explicitly chaining multiple `ap` calls.

## Coordination Motivation

Applicative functors show their strength when you have multiple independent effects. Imagine you’re building a travel site and need to fetch two independent API responses (for example, destinations and events). Unlike the sequential nature of monads, applicatives let you work with multiple tasks concurrently.

For instance, assuming you have a Task functor for asynchronous work (perhaps defined using runspaces or jobs), you could write:

```powershell
# A simplified Task functor.
class Task {
    [ScriptBlock]$RunTask
    Task([ScriptBlock]$fn) { $this.RunTask = $fn }
    
    static [Task] of([object]$x) {
        return [Task]::new({ return $x })
    }
    
    [Task] Map([ScriptBlock]$f) {
        return [Task]::new({ & $f (& $this.RunTask.Invoke()) })
    }
    
    [Task] ap([Task]$other) {
        return $other.Map({ param($x) & $this.RunTask.Invoke() $x })
    }
    
    [string] ToString() {
        return "Task(...)"
    }
}

# For example, a function that renders a page given two HTML snippets.
function RenderPage {
    param($destinations, $events)
    return "<div>$destinations and $events</div>"
}

# Simulate independent API calls returning HTML.
$destinationsTask = [Task]::of("<div>Destinations</div>")
$eventsTask = [Task]::of("<div>Events</div>")

# Using applicative style with our lift function:
function liftA2_Task {
    param(
        [ScriptBlock]$g,
        $f1,
        $f2
    )
    return ($f1.Map($g)).ap($f2)
}

$renderTask = liftA2_Task { param($d, $e) RenderPage $d $e } $destinationsTask $eventsTask
# The final result is a Task wrapping the rendered page.
Write-Output $renderTask
```

Notice that by lifting both the rendering function and the API responses into our applicative world, the two tasks can be executed without waiting on each other—departing from the sequential nature of monads.

## Operators and Derived Definitions

In functional languages that support custom infix operators, you might see symbols such as `<$>` for map and `<*>` for ap. In PowerShell, we work with our defined functions. It’s useful to remember the law:

```
F.of(x).Map(f) === F.of(f).ap(F.of(x))
```

This tells us that mapping a function over a value is equivalent to lifting the function and applying it to the lifted value.

Furthermore, if you already have a monadic definition (with `chain`), you can derive both the functor and applicative interfaces using:

```powershell
# For any monad X, you can define:
# Map derived from chain.
# ap derived from chain and map.
```

In our examples here we chose to implement `ap` directly for potential optimizations (such as concurrency), though it’s good to know the theoretical underpinnings.

## In Summary

Applicative functors let us combine multiple functor-wrapped values with functions applied entirely within the applicative “universe.” With the `of` method to inject values, `map` to transform them, and `ap` to apply functors to each other, we gain a powerful, declarative interface. Helper functions like `liftA2` and `liftA3` further simplify working with functions of several arguments. 

This approach is particularly useful when dealing with independent effects (such as parallel API calls) so that you aren’t forced to sequence operations when not necessary.

In the exercises that follow, you might be asked (for example) to write a function that adds two possibly null numbers using a `Maybe` functor with `ap` or using `liftA2`. You may also apply these ideas to side-effecting IO tasks. 

Next up, we’ll learn how to better work with multiple functors and “disassemble” them in a principled way.
