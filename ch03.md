# Chapter 03: Pure Happiness with Pure Functions

## Oh to Be Pure Again

One key idea in functional programming is that of a *pure function*. A pure function is one where, given the same input, it always returns the same output—without any observable side effects.

### Pure vs. Impure Array Operations

Consider a simple example: extracting a slice from an array. In a pure approach, the original array remains unchanged. In contrast, an impure function might modify the array.

```powershell
# Pure function: Returns a new array slice without modifying the original.
function Get-Slice {
    param(
        [Object[]]$Array,
        [int]$Start,
        [int]$Count
    )
    return $Array[$Start..($Start + $Count - 1)]
}

# Example:
$array = 1,2,3,4,5
Get-Slice -Array $array -Start 0 -Count 3  # Returns: 1,2,3
Get-Slice -Array $array -Start 0 -Count 3  # Always returns: 1,2,3
```

Now consider an impure function that removes items from a list—thereby altering its state:

```powershell
# Impure function: Removes items from the list, changing its state.
function Remove-Slice {
    param(
        [System.Collections.Generic.List[int]]$List,
        [int]$Start,
        [int]$Count
    )
    $result = $List.GetRange($Start, $Count)
    $List.RemoveRange($Start, $Count)
    return $result
}

# Example usage:
$list = New-Object 'System.Collections.Generic.List[int]'
1..5 | ForEach-Object { $list.Add($_) }
Remove-Slice -List $list -Start 0 -Count 3  # Returns: 1,2,3 and modifies $list
Remove-Slice -List $list -Start 0 -Count 3  # Now returns remaining elements
```

In functional programming we favor the pure approach (like `Get-Slice`) so that no external state is modified.

### Checking Age: Impure vs. Pure Functions

Consider another example: a function that checks if an age meets a minimum requirement.

```powershell
# Impure: Depends on mutable global state.
$global:MinimumAge = 21
function Check-Age {
    param($Age)
    return $Age -ge $global:MinimumAge
}

# Example:
Check-Age -Age 22  # Returns: True (but depends on $global:MinimumAge)
```

Now a pure version defines its own constant locally:

```powershell
# Pure: All dependencies are local and immutable.
function Check-AgePure {
    param($Age)
    $minimum = 21
    return $Age -ge $minimum
}

# Example:
Check-AgePure -Age 22  # Always returns: True for 22
```

### Side Effects and Their Impact

A *side effect* is any observable interaction with the world outside the function's local context. This might include:

- Modifying the file system  
- Writing to a database  
- Making an HTTP call  
- Changing a global variable  
- Displaying output (logging, printing)  

Side effects are not inherently bad, but they make functions impure—because the same input might not always produce the same output if external state changes. Pure functions protect us from such uncertainties, making our code more predictable.

### Memoization: Caching Pure Functions

Since pure functions always produce the same output given the same input, we can cache—or memoize—their results. Here’s a simple memoization implementation in PowerShell:

```powershell
# A simple memoization function.
function Memoize {
    param(
        [ScriptBlock]$Function
    )
    # Create an empty cache.
    $cache = @{}
    return {
        param($args)
        $key = $args | ConvertTo-Json
        if (-not $cache.ContainsKey($key)) {
            $cache[$key] = & $Function @args
        }
        return $cache[$key]
    }
}

# A pure function to square a number.
$squareFunction = { param($x) return $x * $x }

# Create a memoized version.
$squareNumber = Memoize -Function $squareFunction

# Example usage:
& $squareNumber 4   # Returns: 16
& $squareNumber 4   # Returns cached: 16
& $squareNumber 5   # Returns: 25
& $squareNumber 5   # Returns cached: 25
```

Memoization shows how pure functions can optimize performance by caching their results for the same input values.

### Referential Transparency and Equational Reasoning

Because pure functions always yield the same result for the same input, expressions involving them are *referentially transparent*. That means you can replace an expression with its corresponding value without altering the program’s behavior. This principle allows us to perform equational reasoning—a powerful tool for refactoring and understanding code.

For example, consider a function that decrements a player’s health:

```powershell
# Returns a new player object with decremented HP (without modifying the original).
function Decrement-HP {
    param($Player)
    $newPlayer = $Player.Clone()
    $newPlayer.HP--
    return $newPlayer
}

function Is-SameTeam {
    param($Player1, $Player2)
    return $Player1.Team -eq $Player2.Team
}

function Punch {
    param($Attacker, $Target)
    if (Is-SameTeam -Player1 $Attacker -Player2 $Target) {
        return $Target
    }
    else {
        return Decrement-HP -Player $Target
    }
}

# Example:
$jobe = @{ Name = "Jobe"; HP = 20; Team = "red" }
$michael = @{ Name = "Michael"; HP = 20; Team = "green" }

Punch -Attacker $jobe -Target $michael  # Returns Michael with HP 19.
```

Since the functions don’t introduce side effects or modify their inputs, every call to `Punch` with the same arguments produces the same result. This property makes our functions easier to test, reason about, and even run in parallel.

### Parallel Code

Because pure functions do not rely on or modify shared state, they can be executed concurrently without risk of race conditions. This makes them ideal for parallel processing scenarios.

## In Summary

In this chapter we explored pure functions in PowerShell. We saw how pure functions—such as our version of `Get-Slice` and `Check-AgePure`—provide reliability, enable memoization, and make code easier to reason about through referential transparency. Despite the occasional need for side effects (like logging or database access), minimizing them and isolating their impact is a core tenet of functional programming.

Up next, we’ll roll up our sleeves and explore another powerful technique: currying.
