# Chapter 12: Traversing the Stone

So far, in our cirque du conteneur, we have tamed our functors (see Chapter 08), juggled multiple effects with our applicative tools (Chapter 10), and even flattened nested functors using our join and chain methods (Chapter 09). Now, we’ll look at traversals—where we “invert” a container of effects into an effect that holds a container. In other words, we change a collection like `[Task Error String]` into a single `Task Error [String]`. This lets us coordinate asynchronous (or other effectful) actions as one future value (much like PowerShell’s equivalent of JavaScript’s Promise.all()).

## Types n' Types

Imagine we have the following functions:

- **Read-File**: Reads a file and returns its content wrapped in a Task.  
- **firstWords**: Takes a string and returns the first three words.  
- **tldr**: Combines these so that it takes a filename and returns a Task containing a “summary” string.

For instance, we can define:

```powershell
# readFile :: FileName -> Task Error String
function Read-File {
    param([string]$filename)
    # Wrap the file read operation in a Task.
    return [Task]::new({ Get-Content -Path $filename -Raw })
}

# firstWords :: String -> String
function firstWords {
    param([string]$s)
    $words = $s -split '\s+'
    # Take at most the first three words.
    if ($words.Length -gt 3) {
        $firstThree = $words[0..2]
    }
    else {
        $firstThree = $words
    }
    return ($firstThree -join ' ')
}

# tldr :: FileName -> Task Error String
function tldr {
    param([string]$filename)
    # Read the file, then map over its content.
    return (Read-File -filename $filename).Map({ param($content) firstWords $content })
}
```

Now suppose we have an array of filenames and mapping `tldr` over them produces an array of Tasks:

```powershell
$files = @("file1.txt", "file2.txt")
$tasks = $files | ForEach-Object { tldr $_ }
# $tasks is now [Task Error String[]] (an array of Task wrappers)
```

But what if we want a single Task that yields an array of summaries? That’s where **traverse** (or its sibling, **sequence**) comes in.

## The Traversable Interface: Sequence & Traverse

We define a helper function, **Sequence-Tasks**, that “inverts” an array of Tasks into one Task holding an array. (This is analogous to using JavaScript’s `sequence` or `traverse` functions.)

```powershell
function Sequence-Tasks {
    param([object[]]$tasks)
    # Seed with a Task containing an empty array.
    $seed = [Task]::of(@())
    foreach ($t in $tasks) {
        # Combine using Map and ap so that the array builds up.
        $seed = ($seed.Map({
            param($arr)
            # Return a function that appends an element to the array.
            return { param($x) $arr + $x }
        })).ap($t)
    }
    return $seed
}

# Now, instead of having an array of Tasks, we can sequence them:
$combinedTask = Sequence-Tasks -tasks $tasks
# $combinedTask is of type Task Error [String]
```

When you finally “run” the Task (by invoking its UnsafePerformIO or similar method), you’ll obtain a single result holding all file summaries.

## Type Feng Shui

Traversals let us rearrange types for our own benefit. For example, instead of having a collection of effectful values (e.g. `[Task Error String]`), we can get one effectful collection (`Task Error [String]`). This is especially useful in asynchronous workflows or when combining validation results.

Consider another situation. You might have functions like:

- **Get-Attribute**: Retrieves an attribute from a UI element and returns a `Maybe String`.
- **$ (Select-Element)**: Returns an IO-wrapped Node.
- **getControlNode**: Combines these to return an `IO (Maybe Node)`.

If these wrappers are nested (e.g. `IO (Maybe (IO Node))`), traversals can “invert” the nesting. For example, using a natural helper function such as `Traverse-IO` (which you could define on your IO functor) you could end up with a simpler signature:

```powershell
# Suppose $ is defined to select a UI element and returns IO Node.
# And getAttribute returns Maybe String.

# getControlNode :: Selector -> IO (Maybe Node)
$controlNode = ($(“#myControl")).Map({ param($node# Suppose $ is defined to select a UI element and returns IO Node.
# And getAttribute returns Maybe String.

# getControlNode :: Selector -> IO (Maybe Node)
$controlNode = ($(“#myControl")).Map({ param($node

GitHub Copilot: Below is a PowerShell-adapted version of Chapter 12. It explains the Traversable interface—specifically, how to “invert” nested applicative structures with functions such as sequence and traverse. In our PowerShell world, we’ll work with our container types (such as our Container, Maybe, Task, etc. from previous chapters) and show how to rearrange them to make working with multiple effects simpler.

# Chapter 12: Traversing the Stone

So far, in our cirque du conteneur, we’ve tamed our functors by mapping, applying, and joining them (see Chapters 8–11). Now we move to traversals. Imagine that you have a collection of functor-wrapped values (for example, an array of Task-wrapped strings). Instead of ending up with a collection like `[Task Error String]` (many tasks in an array), wouldn’t it be far more convenient to have one task that returns an array of strings—i.e. `Task Error [String]`? Traversing does exactly that: it “inverts” the position of the outer traversable and the inner applicative.

## Wrangling the Types

Let’s say we have a function that reads files asynchronously, returning a Task that eventually yields the file contents:

```powershell
# readFile :: String -> Task Error String
function Read-File {
    param([string]$fileName)
    # For illustration, we wrap Get-Content in a Task-like functor.
    return [Task]::new({ Get-Content -Path $fileName -Raw })
}
```

We might then define a function that takes the first three words of a string. (Think of firstWords in the JavaScript example.)

```powershell
# firstWords :: String -> String
function Get-FirstWords {
    param([string]$input)
    $words = $input -split '\s+'
    # Take the first three words and join them.
    return ($words[0..([Math]::Min(2, $words.Length - 1))] -join ' ')
}
```

Finally, we can compose these functions so that a “tldr” version of our file is produced:

```powershell
# tldr :: FileName -> Task Error String
function Get-Tldr {
    param([string]$fileName)
    # First read the file and then map Get-FirstWords over the result.
    return (Read-File -fileName $fileName).Map({ param($s) Get-FirstWords $s })
}
```

Now, if we have an array of file names, mapping Get-Tldr over it would yield an array of Tasks (i.e. [Task Error String]). Not very helpful when you wish to await all results at once. That’s where traversal comes in.

## The Traversable Interface

The *Traversable* interface gives us two functions:  
- **sequence:** converts a traversable of applicatives into an applicative of traversable  
- **traverse:** maps a function over a traversable and then sequences the result

For our purposes, consider a simplified implementation for a List (or Array) of Tasks. We want to produce a single Task that, when executed, yields an array of results.

### Implementing Sequence for an Array of Tasks

We assume our Task type (see Chapter 10) implements Map and ap. Here’s a simple `Sequence-Tasks` function to invert an array of Task objects into a single Task wrapping an array:

```powershell
function Sequence-Tasks {
    param(
        [object[]]$tasks  # Array of Task objects, e.g. Task Error String
    )
    # Seed value is a Task that wraps an empty array.
    $seed = [Task]::of(@())
    
    # Reduce the array of tasks.
    return $tasks | ForEach-Object -Begin {
        $acc = $seed
    } -Process {
        # For each task, we combine the accumulator and the task.
        # We use Map to curry a function that appends the result,
        # then ap to apply it to the task.
        $acc = ($acc.Map({ param($arr) { return { param($x) $arr + $x } } })).ap($_)
    } -End {
        $acc
    }
}
```

Here, we treat the array like a List and use a reduction that leverages `Map` and `ap` from our Task functor. The idea is that we concatenate each task’s result onto an accumulating array. (In a more complete implementation you would check for failures in the task chain.)

### Implementing Traverse for Arrays

Traverse is simply mapping a function over an array, then sequencing the result:

```powershell
function Traverse-Tasks {
    param(
        [ScriptBlock]$fn,  # Function: a -> Task Error b
        [object[]]$items  # Array of type a
    )
    # Map each item to a Task, then sequence
    $mapped = $items | ForEach-Object { & $fn $_ }
    return Sequence-Tasks -tasks $mapped
}
```

Now, if we map our Get-Tldr function over an array of file names, we get an array of Task objects. Traversing them will yield a single Task containing an array of tldr strings:

```powershell
# Usage:
$files = @('file1.txt', 'file2.txt')
$tldrTask = Traverse-Tasks -fn { param($file) Get-Tldr -fileName $file } -items $files

# To execute the Task (assuming our Task type defines an UnsafePerformTask method):
$resultArray = $tldrTask.UnsafePerformTask.Invoke()
Write-Output "TLDRs: $($resultArray -join ', ')"
```

Instead of handling multiple asynchronous tasks individually, we now have a single aggregated Task that returns all results concurrently—similar to JavaScript’s Promise.all().

## Rearranging Nested Effects

Sometimes you have a situation where the inner and outer functors are “swapped.” For example, consider an IO that produces a Task which itself wraps a Maybe value. Traversal (and its sister function, sequence) can “flip” the types:
  
```powershell
# Imagine: IO(Task(Maybe('data')))
# With a proper sequence function for IO or Maybe, we can convert this into:
# Task(IO(Maybe('data')))
```

The idea remains the same: using traverse/sequence, we shift the inner applicative to be the outer one so that we can deal with one asynchronous effect (or error) head on rather than juggling many layers.

## In Summary

The Traversable (or Traversal) interface in our PowerShell adaptation gives us the power to rearrange our types. By using:

- **Sequence-Tasks** to transform an array of Task-wrapped values into one Task holding an array, and  
- **Traverse-Tasks** to map a function over an array and sequence the results,

we gain a powerful tool that helps coordinate asynchronous effects. This operability is crucial when you need to deal with a set of independent effects (such as reading multiple files concurrently) in a coherent manner.

In the exercises that follow, you might be asked to:
- Rearrange nested container types (e.g. shifting a `[Task]` array into a `Task` array),
- Validate collections with traversals, or
- Combine different applicative effects for cleaner, more expressive PowerShell code.

Next up, we’ll take a detour into one of the most powerful interfaces in functional programming – Monoids – which further unifies our approach to composing effects.
