# Chapter 01: What Are We Doing?

## Introductions

Hi there! I'm Professor Franklin Frisby. Pleased to make your acquaintance. In this guide we'll explore functional programming—but... in PowerShell!  
If you're familiar with PowerShell scripting and have dabbled in object-oriented approaches, you’re in a good place. Functional programming might seem odd in a shell environment, yet its principles make your scripts more predictable and easy to understand.  

In this chapter, we'll contrast the pitfalls of mutable state with the clarity of pure functions. Before we get into Christopher Kuech’s additional functions (like `Reduce-Object`, `Merge-Object`, `Test-All`, `Test-Any`, and `Test-Equality`), let’s start by looking at a simple example reimagined in PowerShell.

## A Brief Encounter

Let’s start with a touch of insanity. Here’s our "flock" application in PowerShell. When flocks combine, their seagull counts add up; when they breed, they multiply. First, we show an imperative version—using mutable custom objects:

```powershell
function New-Flock {
    param([int]$Count)
    [PSCustomObject]@{ Seagulls = $Count }
}

function Conjoin-Flock {
    param($FlockA, $FlockB)
    # Imperatively add the seagulls
    $FlockA.Seagulls += $FlockB.Seagulls
    return $FlockA
}

function Breed-Flock {
    param($FlockA, $FlockB)
    # Imperatively multiply the seagulls
    $FlockA.Seagulls *= $FlockB.Seagulls
    return $FlockA
}

$flockA = New-Flock -Count 4
$flockB = New-Flock -Count 2
$flockC = New-Flock -Count 0

# Notice how the mutable state causes unintended side effects.
$result = (Conjoin-Flock -FlockA (Breed-Flock -FlockA (Conjoin-Flock -FlockA $flockC) -FlockB) -FlockA).Seagulls
# Expected: 16, but due to state changes, the value might end up incorrect (e.g. 32)
```

Who on earth would craft such a mutable monstrosity? Tracking state changes in these objects can be a nightmare!

Now let’s see a functional approach, where our functions remain pure and data is immutable. We swap out our custom `Conjoin-Flock` and `Breed-Flock` functions for simple arithmetic functions:

```powershell
# A functional version using pure functions

# Pure functions: no side effects, just input and output.
function Add ($x, $y) { 
    return $x + $y 
}
function Multiply ($x, $y) { 
    return $x * $y 
}

$flockA = 4
$flockB = 2
$flockC = 0

# Note the structure: each function call returns a new value.
$result = Add (Multiply $flockB (Add $flockA $flockC)) (Multiply $flockA $flockB)
# $result equals 16 because no data was mutated along the way.
```

Much simpler, and—more importantly—it’s easy to reason about. The nested function calls might seem a bit confusing at first, but their purity means you can always predict the output.

Let’s reveal the arithmetic behind our operations:

```powershell
# Properties of our arithmetic functions:
# Associative: 
#   Add (Add $x $y) $z  equals  Add $x (Add $y $z)
#
# Commutative: 
#   Add $x $y equals  Add $y $x
#
# Identity:
#   Add $x 0 equals  $x
#
# Distributive:
#   Multiply $x (Add $y $z) equals  Add (Multiply $x $y) (Multiply $x $z)
```

Using these properties, we can simplify the seagull calculations. Starting from

```powershell
Add (Multiply $flockB (Add $flockA $flockC)) (Multiply $flockA $flockB)
```

Because `Add $flockA $flockC` is just `$flockA` (as adding 0 doesn’t change the number), and applying distributivity yields a cleaner expression:

```powershell
Multiply $flockB (Add $flockA $flockA)
```

No need for our own custom functions beyond what’s provided in PowerShell (and later, Christopher Kuech’s module can supply more complex operators for real-world scenarios).

In the chapters to come, we’ll explore deeper topics—merging, reducing, and testing with functions like `Reduce-Object`, `Merge-Object`, `Test-All`, `Test-Any`, and `Test-Equality`—all within the functional paradigm applied to PowerShell.
