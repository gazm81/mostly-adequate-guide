# Chapter 13: Monoids bring it all together

## Wild Combination

In this chapter we explore *monoids* by way of *semigroups*. Monoids are all about combination. They capture the idea of a binary operation that is associative and, when provided with an identity element (called **empty**), allow you to fold, merge, or accumulate values in a predictable way.

In our abstraction, a semigroup is any type that provides a **Concat** method which combines two values (of the same type) into a new value. For example, addition is a binary operation where numbers are “closed,” meaning that combining any two numbers always yields another number. Because addition is associative, we can combine many values without worrying about parentheses:

  (1 + 2) + 3 = 1 + (2 + 3)

Our goal is to capture these ideas in PowerShell.

## Abstracting Addition

Let’s start by implementing a **Sum** type. In PowerShell we can use a class with a property to hold the number, a **Concat** method to add two sums, and a static **Empty** method that gives the identity element.

```powershell
class Sum {
    [int]$X
    Sum ([int]$x) { $this.X = $x }
    
    [Sum] Concat([Sum]$other) {
        return [Sum]::new($this.X + $other.X)
    }
    
    static [Sum] Empty() {
        return [Sum]::new(0)
    }
    
    [string] ToString() {
        return "Sum($($this.X))"
    }
}

# Usage examples:
$sum1 = [Sum]::new(1)
$sum2 = [Sum]::new(3)
$sum3 = $sum1.Concat($sum2)
Write-Output $sum3  # Expected output: Sum(4)
```

Similarly, we can define other semigroups:

```powershell
class Product {
    [int]$X
    Product ([int]$x) { $this.X = $x }
    
    [Product] Concat([Product]$other) {
        return [Product]::new($this.X * $other.X)
    }
    
    static [Product] Empty() {
        return [Product]::new(1)
    }
    
    [string] ToString() {
        return "Product($($this.X))"
    }
}

class Min {
    [double]$X
    Min ([double]$x) { $this.X = $x }
    
    [Min] Concat([Min]$other) {
        $minVal = if ($this.X -lt $other.X) { $this.X } else { $other.X }
        return [Min]::new($minVal)
    }
    
    static [Min] Empty() {
        return [Min]::new([double]::PositiveInfinity)
    }
    
    [string] ToString() { return "Min($($this.X))" }
}

class Max {
    [double]$X
    Max ([double]$x) { $this.X = $x }
    
    [Max] Concat([Max]$other) {
        $maxVal = if ($this.X -gt $other.X) { $this.X } else { $other.X }
        return [Max]::new($maxVal)
    }
    
    static [Max] Empty() {
        return [Max]::new(-[double]::Infinity)
    }
    
    [string] ToString() { return "Max($($this.X))" }
}
```

We can also abstract logical combination. For instance, an **Any** and an **All** type:

```powershell
class Any {
    [bool]$X
    Any ([bool]$x) { $this.X = $x }
    
    [Any] Concat([Any]$other) {
        return [Any]::new($this.X -or $other.X)
    }
    
    static [Any] Empty() {
        return [Any]::new($false)
    }
    
    [string] ToString() { return "Any($($this.X))" }
}

class All {
    [bool]$X
    All ([bool]$x) { $this.X = $x }
    
    [All] Concat([All]$other) {
        return [All]::new($this.X -and $other.X)
    }
    
    static [All] Empty() {
        return [All]::new($true)
    }
    
    [string] ToString() { return "All($($this.X))" }
}
```

You can see the pattern here: each type implements a **Concat** method that combines its value in an associative way, and an **Empty** method that returns the identity element—zero for addition, one for multiplication, Infinity for minimum, and so on.

## Combining Complex Structures

The real power of this abstraction is that you can combine data structures as long as their inner values support semigroup behavior. For example, suppose we have a composite type representing form values. In PowerShell, you could use a PSCustomObject or a dedicated class.

Here’s a simple example using a custom object wrapped by a helper function:

```powershell
function New-Map {
    param([hashtable]$data)
    return [PSCustomObject]@{
        Data = $data
        Concat = {
            param($other)
            # Merge two hashtables (later values override earlier ones)
            $merged = @{}
            $this.Data.GetEnumerator() | ForEach-Object { $merged[$_.Key] = $_.Value }
            $other.Data.GetEnumerator() | ForEach-Object { $merged[$_.Key] = $_.Value }
            return New-Map -data $merged
        }
        ToString = { return ("Map({0})" -f ($this.Data | Out-String).Trim()) }
    }
}

# Example usage:
$map1 = New-Map -data @{ day = 'night' }
$map2 = New-Map -data @{ white = 'nikes' }
$mergedMap = & $map1.Concat($map2)
Write-Output $mergedMap  # Expected: Map({day=night; white=nikes})
```

Much like in the JavaScript version, if the contained value implements Concat, then wrapping it in a functor (or container) that itself implements Concat yields a semigroup as well.

## Monoids: Adding the Identity

A monoid extends a semigroup by providing an **Empty** (identity) element. This identity, when concatenated with any value, leaves that value unchanged:

  1 + 0 = 1  
  0 + 1 = 1

For our types we already defined an **Empty** method. This identity element is useful when you want a safe initial value for a fold (or reduce) operation. For instance:

```powershell
# Folding an array of Sum values:
$values = @([Sum]::new(1), [Sum]::new(2), [Sum]::new(3))
$resultFold = $values | ForEach-Object -Begin { $acc = [Sum]::Empty() } -Process { $acc = $acc.Concat($_) } -End { $acc }
Write-Output $resultFold  # Expected: Sum(6)
```

If the array were empty, starting with the identity element (here, Sum.empty()) guarantees that you get a value of the correct type.

## Other Instances and Compositions

Monoids are not limited to numbers. They can model string concatenation, logical operations, array merging, and even more complex data structures. For example:

```powershell
# Merging two strings:
function New-StringMonoid([string]$s) {
    return [PSCustomObject]@{
        Value = $s
        Concat = { param($other) New-StringMonoid ($this.Value + $other.Value) }
        ToString = { return $this.Value }
    }
}

# Usage:
$str1 = New-StringMonoid "miracle grow"
$str2 = New-StringMonoid "n"
$mergedString = & $str1.Concat($str2)
Write-Output $mergedString  # Expected: miracle grown
```

Or combining event streams (conceptually similar to the examples with **Stream**) can also be modeled as semigroups if you define their concat behavior appropriately.

## Wrapping Up

Monoids provide a powerful abstraction to combine data in a consistent, associative fashion. By ensuring that each type has a **Concat** method and an identity element (**Empty**), we can reduce complexity when folding, merging, or accumulating values. This abstraction is useful both for simple tasks—such as summing numbers—and for more complex application architectures where multiple effects or data streams must be combined.
