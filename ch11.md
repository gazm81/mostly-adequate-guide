# Chapter 11: Transform Again, Naturally

We are about to discuss *natural transformations* in the context of practical utility in everyday PowerShell code. These functions change one functor’s “container type” into another without ever peeking at (or altering) the contained value. They preserve the structure of `Map`—that is, for any transformation `nt` and any function `f`, the law

  `Map(f) ∘ nt  ===  nt ∘ Map(f)`

holds true.

## Curse This Nest

Sometimes in our functions the types become nested – for instance, you might end up with a nested IO or Maybe:

```powershell
# Imagine these nested functors:
[Maybe]::of([Maybe]::of('b'));
[IO]::new({ return [Task]::of([IO]::of(1000)) });
# or even:
[Container]::of([Container]::of('bee thousand'));
```

These extra layers are cumbersome. In our PowerShell adaptations, we keep our code clear by “flattening” them via natural transformations.

## A Situational Comedy

Consider a scenario where you have several effects:
- `Get-Value` retrieves text from a UI element and returns an object of type `Task` wrapping a `Maybe` string.
- `Post-Comment` takes a string and returns a `Task` with a comment.
- `Validate-Input` takes a string and returns an `Either` (in our case, a `Left` or `Right`) indicating if validation was successful.

In a typical situation you might have a type signature like this (in comments):

```plaintext
# getValue :: Selector -> Task Error (Maybe String)
# postComment :: String -> Task Error Comment
# validate :: String -> Either ValidationError String
```

And a composed function might look messy because you’re ending up with nested types:

```plaintext
# saveComment :: () -> Task Error (Maybe (Either ValidationError (Task Error Comment)))
```

Our goal is to homogenize such types. In our PowerShell approach we define natural transformation functions which convert one functor to another—as long as they satisfy the law that mapping before or after the conversion gives the same result.

## All Natural

A **natural transformation** in our context is a function that converts one functor `f` to another `g` while preserving structure; that is, a function of the form:

  `nt :: f a -> g a`

Here are some examples implemented in PowerShell.

### Example: Converting Identity to Maybe

Assume we have an Identity functor (a trivial container holding a value):

```powershell
# Identity functor as a simple class.
class Identity {
    [object]$Value
    Identity([object]$x) { $this.Value = $x }
    static [Identity] of([object]$x) { return [Identity]::new($x) }
    [Identity] Map([ScriptBlock]$f) {
        return [Identity]::of(& $f $this.Value)
    }
    [string] ToString() {
        return "Identity($($this.Value))"
    }
}
```

Now define a natural transformation from Identity to Maybe:

```powershell
# Natural transformation: Identity a -> Maybe a
function IdToMaybe {
    param([Identity]$id)
    # We assume Identity stores its value in .Value.
    return [Maybe]::of($id.Value)
}
```

This transformation is natural insofar as if you were to first map a function over the Identity and then convert it, it would be the same as converting first and mapping after.

### Example: Converting Either to Task

When working with Either, we want to use the “right” side to represent success. Our transformation converts an Either into a Task:

```powershell
# Natural transformation: Either a b -> Task a b
function EitherToTask {
    param($either) # either is an instance of Either (Right for success, Left for failure)
    
    # Here we assume that if $either is a Left, we want to produce a rejected Task;
    # if it's Right, we produce a resolved Task. Using our Task functor from earlier:
    if ($either -is [Left]) {
        return [Task]::new({ throw $either.Value })
    }
    else {
        return [Task]::of($either.Value)
    }
}
```

### Example: Converting IO to Task

The transformation from IO to Task converts a synchronous IO wrapper into an asynchronous task:
  
```powershell
# Natural transformation: IO a -> Task () a
function IoToTask {
    param([IO]$io)
    # Here the IO functor’s contained scriptblock returns the value.
    return [Task]::new({
        return $io.UnsafePerformIO.Invoke()
    })
}
```

### Example: Converting Maybe to Task

Since a Maybe may represent a “Nothing” value, converting it into a Task is done by rejecting (if nothing) or wrapping the value:
  
```powershell
# Natural transformation: Maybe a -> Task () a
function MaybeToTask {
    param([Maybe]$maybe)
    if ($maybe.IsNothing) {
        # Return a rejected Task (simulate rejection by throwing an error)
        return [Task]::new({ throw "Nothing found" })
    }
    else {
        return [Task]::of($maybe.Value)
    }
}
```

Notice that in all cases these natural transformations do not inspect or modify the value other than “unwrapping” it and rewrapping it in another functor.

## The Natural Transformation Law

The key property is that for any function `f`, the following holds:

  `Map(f) ∘ nt  ===  nt ∘ Map(f)`

In PowerShell, that means if you take, say, an Identity instance, map a function over it, then apply `IdToMaybe`, you’ll get the same result as if you first applied `IdToMaybe` and then mapped the function over the resulting Maybe.

For example:

```powershell
$identity = [Identity]::of("powerShell");
# Map function that converts the string to uppercase first on Identity:
$result1 = ($identity.Map({ param($x) $x.ToUpper() })) | IdToMaybe;
# Or convert to Maybe and then map:
$result2 = IdToMaybe -id $identity;
$result2 = $result2.Map({ param($x) $x.ToUpper() });

Write-Output $result1  # Expected: Just(POWERSHELL)
Write-Output $result2  # Expected: Just(POWERSHELL)
```

Both approaches yield the same result, thus meeting the natural transformation property.

## In Summary

Natural transformations are powerful tools that let us homogenize our increasingly tangled functor types. They allow us to convert one container type (such as Identity, Maybe, Either, or IO) to another while preserving the ability to map functions over them.

In our PowerShell rendition, we’ve defined several transformations:
- `IdToMaybe` converts an Identity value to a Maybe.
- `EitherToTask` converts an Either into a Task.
- `IoToTask` and `MaybeToTask` similarly convert from IO or Maybe into Task.

These transformations keep our pipelines “natural” by ensuring that mapping before or after them gives the same outcome. As our code grows complex with nested functors (much like tangled earbuds), natural transformations help us tidy up our types, maintain composability, and prevent the “hairy” mess that comes with over-nesting.

Next up, we’ll look at even higher abstractions—Traversable functors—that let you sequence effects over structures.
