# Chapter 09: Monadic Onions

## Pointed Functor Factory

In functional programming we love to “lift” any value into a container so that we can map over it as usual. In our previous chapters we built functors like `Container`, `Maybe`, `Either`, and `IO` with an `of` method. That method—also known by names like `pure`, `point`, or `return`—provides a minimal context in which we can place a value and then use `Map` to transform it.

For example, using our IO functor from before we could write:

```powershell
# Using our IO type defined in Chapter 08:
# IO.of('tetris').Map({ param($s) "$s master" })
# => IO('tetris master')
```

Similarly, with Maybe:

```powershell
# [Maybe]::of(1336).Map({ param($x) $x + 1 })
# Would yield: Just(1337)
```

**Important:** With `Either`, we define `of` using the `Right` branch because only a functor that can map should be “pointed”. In other words, `Left` is reserved for signalling failure and does not make sense for `of`. In our implementation, `of` always means “wrap this value in the success case.”  

From now on, we’ll use our `of` methods (or static constructors) like responsible adults.

## Flattening Nested Functors with Join

Sometimes you’ll get an extra layer of structure. For example, you might have a nested IO:

```powershell
# Imagine: IO(IO('pizza'))
# We want to flatten it into: IO('pizza')
```

We can define a `Join` method for our functors. In PowerShell classes, it might look like this. For our Maybe type, add a `Join` method:

```powershell
class Maybe {
    [object]$Value
    Maybe([object]$x) { $this.Value = $x }
    
    static [Maybe] of([object]$x) {
        return [Maybe]::new($x)
    }
    
    [bool] get_IsNothing() { return ($this.Value -eq $null) }
    
    [Maybe] Map([ScriptBlock]$f) {
        if ($this.IsNothing) { return $this }
        else { return [Maybe]::of(& $f $this.Value) }
    }
    
    # Join: if the contained value is already a Maybe, then unwrap it.
    [Maybe] Join() {
        if ($this.IsNothing) { return [Maybe]::of($null) }
        elseif ($this.Value -is [Maybe]) { return $this.Value }
        else { return $this }
    }
    
    [string] ToString() {
        if ($this.IsNothing) { return "Nothing" }
        else { return "Just($($this.Value))" }
    }
}

# Usage example:
$mmaybe = [Maybe]::of([Maybe]::of('nunchucks'))
# $mmaybe.ToString() returns: Just(Just(nunchucks))
$flattened = $mmaybe.Join()
# $flattened.ToString() returns: Just(nunchucks)
```

For our IO functor, we might define join similarly:

```powershell
class IO {
    [ScriptBlock]$UnsafePerformIO
    IO([ScriptBlock]$fn) { $this.UnsafePerformIO = $fn }
    
    static [IO] of([object]$x) {
        # Wrap the plain value in an IO.
        return [IO]::new({ return $x })
    }
    
    [IO] Map([ScriptBlock]$f) {
        return [IO]::new({ & $f (& $this.UnsafePerformIO) })
    }
    
    [IO] Join() {
        # Flatten two layers of IO.
        $outer = $this.UnsafePerformIO.Invoke()
        # Assume $outer is a IO instance.
        return [IO]::new({ return $outer.UnsafePerformIO.Invoke() })
    }
    
    [string] ToString() { return "IO(...)" }
}
```

Now, whenever we have a nested functor (like IO(IO(...)) or Maybe(Maybe(...))), we can flatten it with `Join`.

## Introducing Chain (or flatMap)

Often you’ll find yourself doing a `Map` immediately followed by a `Join`. We can combine these to get a `Chain` function. This is the monadic bind—that is, applying a function that itself returns a functor and then flattening the result.

Let’s define a helper function called `Chain` for any functor that supports `Map` and `Join`:

```powershell
# A generic chain function.
function Chain {
    param(
        [ScriptBlock]$f, # A function from a to a functor of b.
        $monad         # Our functor instance.
    )
    return ($monad.Map($f)).Join()
}

# Example usage with Maybe:
# Let's say safeProp is a function that returns a Maybe.

function SafeProp {
    param(
        [string]$prop,
        [hashtable]$obj
    )
    if ($obj.ContainsKey($prop)) {
        return [Maybe]::of($obj[$prop])
    } else {
        return [Maybe]::of($null)
    }
}

# Now, chaining safeProp to get nested properties:
# Imagine a user:
$user = @{
    addresses = @(
        @{ street = @{ name = 'Mulburry'; number = 8402 } }
    )
}

# Using Map/Join:
$maybeAddress = SafeProp -prop 'addresses' -obj $user
$maybeHead = ($maybeAddress.Map({ param($addrs) $addrs[0] })).Join()
$maybeStreet = Chain { param($addr) SafeProp -prop 'street' -obj $addr } $maybeHead
# $maybeStreet should now be Just(@{ name = 'Mulburry'; number = 8402 })

# Alternatively, using our Chain helper in a pipeline fashion:
$firstAddressStreet = Chain { param($addr) SafeProp -prop 'street' -obj $addr } `
                         ((Chain { param($addrs) [Maybe]::of($addrs[0]) } (SafeProp -prop 'addresses' -obj $user)))
```

The `Chain` (or flatMap) operation lets you avoid manually unwrapping nested containers.

## Examples of Chaining

Let’s look at an example that mimics reading a file and then logging its contents. Imagine these functions:

```powershell
# readFile :: String -> IO String
function Read-File {
    param([string]$filename)
    return [IO]::new({ Get-Content -Path $filename -Raw })
}

# log :: String -> IO String
function Log {
    param([string]$msg)
    return [IO]::new({
        Write-Host $msg
        return $msg
    })
}

# To chain operations:
function Cat {
    param([string]$filename)
    # Get the file, then log its content.
    $ioContent = Read-File -filename $filename
    # We use Map then Join to flatten:
    $ioLog = ($ioContent.Map({ param($content) Log -msg $content })).Join()
    return $ioLog
}

# Usage:
$catResult = Cat -filename '.\ch09_ps.md'
# To see the final output, run the unsafe action:
$final = $catResult.UnsafePerformIO.Invoke()
```

This example shows how an IO wrapped inside an IO can be collapsed with `Join` (or using our `Chain` helper instead).

## Monadic Laws

Two main laws help us reason about monads:

- **Associativity:**  
  Flattening using `Join` in nested ways should be associative. In PowerShell, it means that  
  `(m.Map({ param(x) $f.Invoke(x) })).Map({ param(y) $g.Invoke(y) })` when flattened should be equivalent to mapping a composed function and then joining.

- **Identity (Triangle Identity):**  
  For any monad `M`, using `of` and then `Join` (or mapping with `of`) is equivalent to the identity function:
  
  ```powershell
  # For any value a in M:
  ( [IO]::of($a) ).Join()  # should yield an IO wrapping a, just as $a.
  ```

These laws guarantee that when you use `Chain` (or flatMap), you will get a predictable and consistent flow of data.

## Mixing Metaphors and Eliminating Nested Containers

Often our functions can return nested monadic values. For example, chaining a series of asynchronous tasks or extracting nested properties might lead to multiple layers of functors. Using `Join` and `Chain` (i.e. mapping then flattening) lets us collapse these layers into one smooth interface.

Consider a use case similar to JavaScript’s safe property access:
  
```powershell
# Suppose we have a user with nested addresses.
$user = @{
    addresses = @(
        @{ street = @{ name = 'Walnut St'; number = 22 } }
    )
}

# Using our safe property lookup and chain:
$maybeStreetName = Chain {
    param($addr)
    # Extract the street property:
    Chain { param($st) SafeProp -prop 'name' -obj $st } (SafeProp -prop 'street' -obj $addr)
} ((Chain { param($adds) [Maybe]::of($adds[0]) } (SafeProp -prop 'addresses' -obj $user)))

# $maybeStreetName should now be Just('Walnut St') or Nothing if any lookup fails.
```

This example demonstrates how `Chain` replaces the need for multiple nested `Map` and `Join` calls, yielding a more streamlined and declarative approach.

## In Summary

Monads let us drill down into nested computations and sequence dependent operations without losing our compositional power. With our `of` method, we can inject any value into a functor. When that functor nests (via mapping functions that themselves return functors), we can flatten it with `Join` and even combine those two steps using `Chain`.  

This approach not only helps us structure asynchronous tasks (like reading files or logging output), but it also empowers us to safely handle errors using types like `Maybe` and `Either`. These ideas give us the power to write pure, declarative, and robust PowerShell code—even when dealing with side effects.

Next, we’ll explore how applicative functors further simplify combining independent effects.
