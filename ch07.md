## What's Your Type?

If you're new to the functional world, it won't be long before you find yourself knee deep in type signatures. Types are the meta language that enables people from all different backgrounds to communicate succinctly and effectively. In many functional languages, we use the Hindley‑Milner system for type inference and documentation. Although PowerShell is dynamically typed, we can still annotate our functions with type signatures in comments.

When working with pure functions, type signatures express the intimate secrets of a function. In a single, compact line, they expose behavior and intention. For example, consider the following PowerShell function with its signature written in a comment:

```powershell
# capitalize :: String -> String
function Capitalize {
    param([string]$s)
    # Returns a string with the first character in uppercase and the rest in lowercase.
    if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($s)) {
        return $s
    }
    return $s.Substring(0,1).ToUpper() + $s.Substring(1).ToLower()
}

# Example:
Write-Output (Capitalize 'smurf')  # Outputs: Smurf
```

Here, `Capitalize` is documented as taking a `String` and returning a `String`, much like what you’d see in a Hindley‑Milner type signature.

Let’s look at a few more annotated examples:

```powershell
# strLength :: String -> Number
function StrLength {
    param([string]$s)
    return $s.Length
}

# join :: String -> [String] -> String
function Join-Strings {
    param(
        [string]$separator,
        [string[]]$strings
    )
    return [string]::Join($separator, $strings)
}

# match :: Regex -> String -> [String]
function Match {
    param(
        [regex]$pattern,
        [string]$s
    )
    # Returns an array of all matches
    return $pattern.Matches($s) | ForEach-Object { $_.Value }
}

# replace :: Regex -> String -> String -> String
# strLength :: String -> Number
function StrLength {
    param([string]$s)
    return $s.Length
}

# join :: String -> [String] -> String
function Join-Strings {
    param(
        [string]$separator,
        [string[]]$strings
    )
    return [string]::Join($separator, $strings)
}

# match :: Regex -> String -> [String]
function Match {
    param(
        [regex]$pattern,
        [string]$s
    )
    # Returns an array of all matches
    return $pattern.Matches($s) | ForEach-Object { $_.Value }
}

# replace :: Regex -> String -> String -> String

GitHub Copilot: Below is a PowerShell‐adapted version of Chapter 07. In this version we discuss Hindley‑Milner type signatures as a documentation and reasoning tool—even in a dynamic language like PowerShell. Although PowerShell doesn’t enforce these signatures at compile time, we can use comments to express our intent and document our functions.

# Chapter 07: Hindley‑Milner and Me

## What’s Your Type?

If you’re new to functional programming you’ll soon find yourself knee‐deep in type signatures. In the functional world types are the meta language that lets people from different backgrounds communicate succinctly and effectively. Most often these are expressed in a system called "Hindley‑Milner", and in this chapter we’ll examine how even in PowerShell we can harness this style for documentation and reasoning.

When working with pure functions, type signatures reveal behavior and intention in a single, compact line. They tell you what input a function expects and what output it will produce. Even if PowerShell is dynamically typed, we can annotate our functions so that they “whisper” their secrets to us. For example, for a function that capitalizes a word you might write:

```powershell
# capitalize :: String -> String
function Capitalize {
    param([string]$s)
    if (-not $s) { return $s }
    $first = $s[0].ToUpper()
    $rest  = $s.Substring(1).ToLower()
    return "$first$rest"
}

# Usage:
Capitalize 'powerShell'  # Outputs: PowerShell
```

Here, the comment shows that `Capitalize` takes a `String` and returns a `String`. We can treat these annotations as a form of documentation—and as a guide for our thinking.

Let’s look at a few more examples.

```powershell
# strLength :: String -> Int
function StrLength {
    param([string]$s)
    return $s.Length
}

# join :: String -> [String] -> String
function Join-Strings {
    param(
        [string]$separator,
        [string[]]$strings
    )
    return ($strings -join $separator)
}

# match :: Regex -> String -> [String]
function Match-Regex {
    param(
        [regex]$pattern,
        [string]$input
    )
    # Returns the matches as an array.
    return ([regex]::Matches($input, $pattern)).Value
}

# replace :: Regex -> String -> String -> String
function Replace-Regex {
    param(
        [regex]$pattern,
        [string]$replacement,
        [string]$input
    )
    return $input -replace $pattern, $replacement
}
```

In the above examples we use comments to mimic type signatures. For instance, `Match-Regex` is annotated as taking a `Regex` and a `String` and returning an array of strings. Notice how currying (familiar to our functional friends) can be simulated by partial application. For example, we might “curry” our match function:

```powershell
# match :: Regex -> (String -> [String])
# onHoliday :: String -> [String]
$OnHoliday = { param($input) Match-Regex -pattern ([regex]'holiday') -input $input }

# Usage:
$matches = & $OnHoliday 'It is a holiday in the neighborhood'
```

A few other useful functions in the functional toolkit:

```powershell
# id :: a -> a
function Id {
    param($x)
    return $x
}

# head :: [a] -> a
function Head {
    param([object[]]$xs)
    return $xs[0]
}

# map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
function Map {
    param(
        [ScriptBlock]$f,
        [object[]]$xs
    )
    return $xs | ForEach-Object { & $f $_ }
}

# filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
function Filter {
    param(
        [ScriptBlock]$predicate,
        [object[]]$xs
    )
    return $xs | Where-Object { & $predicate $_ }
}

# reduce :: ((b, a) -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
function Reduce {
    param(
        [ScriptBlock]$f,
        $initial,
        [object[]]$xs
    )
    $acc = $initial
    foreach ($x in $xs) {
        $acc = & $f $acc $x
    }
    return $acc
}
```

Notice the polymorphic nature of these functions. In our annotations we use type variables (such as `a` and `b`) to indicate that these functions work uniformly for any type. For example, `Id` can be seen as having the signature:

```powershell
# id :: a -> a
```

This means if you pass a string, you get a string; if you pass a number, you get a number. This polymorphism is a cornerstone of reasoning in functional programming.

## Tales from the Cryptic

From textbooks to blog posts, Hindley‑Milner type signatures are everywhere. They “free” us from ambiguity by precisely stating what a function is meant to do. For instance, consider the following (informal) signatures:

```powershell
# head :: [a] -> a
# map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
```

The `head` function must return an element of the same type as the list’s elements, and `map` transforms each element of a list from type `a` to type `b`. Such annotations reduce the universe of possible implementations. Ask yourself: what else could `head` do if it’s given no information about `a` except that it is the element type of the array? Its only reasonable action is to return one of those elements.

Let’s look at another example using our functional helpers:

```powershell
# reverse :: [a] -> [a]
function Reverse-List {
    param([object[]]$xs)
    return [array]::Reverse($xs); $xs
}
```

From its type signature alone, it’s clear that `Reverse-List` returns an array of the same type `a` that was passed in. It cannot, for example, change the type or sort the list because it has no knowledge of `a`. This is an expression of *parametricity*—the function works uniformly over all types.

Finally, consider some veritable “free theorems” that follow from our signatures:

```powershell
# Given:
# head :: [a] -> a
# map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
#
# A free theorem might state that:
# map(f) ∘ head ≡ head ∘ map(f)
#
# Meaning:
# Applying f to the head of an array is equivalent to taking the head of an array that has been mapped with f.
```

While PowerShell won’t enforce these rules, thinking in these terms helps us design functions that are both composable and predictable.

## Constraints

Sometimes we want to restrict the domain of our functions. In strongly typed languages you might see signatures like:

```haskell
-- sort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
```

In PowerShell we can’t enforce typeclass constraints, but we can document our constraints in comments—for example, we can note that a sort function is only sensible for comparable types.

```powershell
# sort :: (a qualifies as Ord) => [a] -> [a]
function Sort-List {
    param([object[]]$xs)
    return $xs | Sort-Object
}
```

## In Summary

Hindley‑Milner type signatures offer a powerful lens for understanding function behavior. Even in a language like PowerShell, using these annotations as documentation not only clarifies our intent but also guides us toward writing more robust, composable code. By thinking in types, we can almost “hear” what our functions are trying to tell us.

Next up, we’ll see how these ideas play into designing even more complex systems.
