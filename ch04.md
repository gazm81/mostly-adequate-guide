# Chapter 04: Currying

## Can't Live If Livin' Is without You

My Dad once explained that there are things we can live without until we acquire them—a microwave, a smartphone, or even the internet. For me, currying is one of those game-changing tools.

The idea is simple: you call a function with fewer arguments than it expects. It returns a function that takes the remaining arguments. You can either supply all arguments at once or feed them in one by one.

### A Simple Curried Function in PowerShell

Unlike JavaScript’s built‑in ability with arrow functions and closures, PowerShell doesn’t natively curry functions—but we can simulate it with scriptblocks. For example, let’s define a curried "Add" function:

```powershell
# A curried Add function: returns a function that adds its argument to a preset value.
function Add {
    param($x)
    return {
        param($y)
        return $x + $y
    }
}

# Usage:
$increment = Add 1      # Pre-loads the first argument (1)
$addTen    = Add 10     # Pre-loads the first argument (10)

Write-Output (& $increment 2) # Outputs: 3
Write-Output (& $addTen 2)    # Outputs: 12
```

Here, calling `Add 1` returns a function that “remembers” the initial value 1.

### Building Curried Helpers

Often, we want to pre-load a function with some arguments so that the data we operate on is kept last. For instance, consider a function that tests if a string contains a given pattern. First, we define an uncurried version:

```powershell
function Match {
    param(
        [string]$Pattern,
        [string]$Input
    )
    if ($Input -match $Pattern) {
        # Return the first match (from the automatic $matches variable)
        return $matches[0]
    }
    return $null
}

# Normal usage:
Match 'r' 'hello world'  # Returns: 'r' if found, $null otherwise.
```

Now, we can create a curried version by fixing the pattern and later applying the string:

```powershell
function CurryMatch {
    param(
        [string]$Pattern
    )
    return {
        param([string]$Input)
        return (Match -Pattern $Pattern -Input $Input)
    }
}

# Pre-load the pattern:
$hasLetterR = CurryMatch 'r'

# Use the curried function:
Write-Output (& $hasLetterR 'hello world')   # Outputs: r
Write-Output (& $hasLetterR 'just js and ps')  # Outputs: $null if not found
```

We follow the same strategy for other common operations. For example, a curried replace function can be set up so that our data (a string) is always the last argument:

```powershell
function Replace {
    param(
        [string]$Pattern,
        [string]$Replacement,
        [string]$Input
    )
    return $Input -replace $Pattern, $Replacement
}

function CurryReplace {
    param(
        [string]$Pattern
    )
    return {
        param([string]$Replacement)
        return {
            param([string]$Input)
            return (Replace -Pattern $Pattern -Replacement $Replacement -Input $Input)
        }
    }
}

# Partially apply:
$noVowels = CurryReplace '[aeiou]'  # Pre-load the pattern.

# Now define a function that censors vowels:
$censor = & $noVowels '*'           # Pre-load the replacement.
Write-Output (& $censor 'Chocolate Rain')  # Outputs: Ch*c*l*t* R**n
```

Similarly, you can create curried versions for common array operations. For instance, consider a curried version of `Filter`:

```powershell
# A normal filter function using Where-Object.
function Filter {
    param(
        [ScriptBlock]$Predicate,
        [Object[]]$Array
    )
    return $Array | Where-Object { & $Predicate $_ }
}

# A curried filter function:
function CurryFilter {
    param(
        [ScriptBlock]$Predicate
    )
    return {
        param([Object[]]$Array)
        return (Filter -Predicate $Predicate -Array $Array)
    }
}

# Example: Filter strings that match a pattern.
$hasLetterR = CurryMatch 'r'  # Reusing our curried match function.
$filterR   = CurryFilter { param($str) & $hasLetterR $str }

# Usage:
$strings = @('rock and roll', 'smooth jazz', 'drum circle')
Write-Output (& $filterR $strings)  # Should include only strings with 'r'
```

### Partial Application and the Data-Last Pattern

By positioning the data you're operating on as the last argument in your curried functions, you make it easier to pre-load the environment with configuration options. In our examples, functions like `Match`, `Replace`, and `Filter` are curried so that the actual data (a string or array) is applied last.

This approach minimizes boilerplate code and enhances readability. You can “pre-load” functions with specific configurations—like our `$hasLetterR` or `$censor` examples—and reuse them throughout your scripts.

### In Summary

Currying in PowerShell can make your code less verbose and more modular. Though PowerShell does not offer currying out of the box, you can simulate it with scriptblocks and closure over pre-loaded parameters. This technique allows you to construct specialized helper functions (like `$increment`, `$hasLetterR`, or `$censor`) and transform functions (like `Filter`) into more flexible, easily composed operations.

Up next, we’ll explore another essential tool for functional programming: composing functions.
