# Chapter 02: First Class Functions

## A Quick Review

When we say functions are *first class*, we mean they can be treated like any other value. In PowerShell this is natural—functions (or more generally, scriptblocks) can be stored in variables, passed as parameters, and manipulated just like any other data type.

That’s not new news for JavaScript folks—but it’s worth repeating, especially when we see developers needlessly wrapping functions. Let’s look at a simple (and redundant) example.

Consider this PowerShell code:

```powershell
# An unnecessarily wrapped function
function Hi {
    param($name)
    return "Hi $name"
}

function Greeting {
    param($name)
    # Simply calls Hi with the same argument
    return Hi -name $name
}
```

Here, `Greeting` just wraps `Hi` without adding value. We can treat `Hi` as a first class citizen and assign it directly:

```powershell
# Assign the function reference to a variable
$Greeting = ${function:Hi}

# Using the function directly:
& $Greeting "Times"  # Outputs: Hi Times
```

For clarity, let’s see the behavior interactively:

```powershell
# Displaying the function definition (as a scriptblock)
${function:Hi}

# Invoking the function
& ${function:Hi} "Jonas"  # Returns: Hi Jonas
```

Notice there’s no need for an extra function wrapper. Redundant wrapping only adds extra code to maintain.

Here’s another typical scenario. Imagine we have a function that fetches data from a server:

```powershell
# The "ignorant" approach – wrapping the callback unnecessarily:
function Get-ServerStuff {
    param($callback)
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://example.com" | ForEach-Object { & $callback $_ }
}
```

Since the callback is already a function, we can pass it directly. In PowerShell this means we can simply write:

```powershell
# The "enlightened" approach:
function Get-ServerStuff {
    param($callback)
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://example.com" | ForEach-Object $callback
}
```

This removes an unnecessary layer of indirection.

Another common pattern is seen in how we might bundle functions together. Consider this controller written in a verbose manner:

```powershell
$BlogController = @{
    index   = { param($posts) return (Views.Index $posts) }
    show    = { param($post) return (Views.Show $post) }
    create  = { param($attrs) return (Db.Create $attrs) }
    update  = { param($post, $attrs) return (Db.Update $post $attrs) }
    destroy = { param($post) return (Db.Destroy $post) }
}
```

Since each entry is simply forwarding its arguments to another function, you can instead write:

```powershell
$BlogController = @{
    index   = ${function:Views.Index}
    show    = ${function:Views.Show}
    create  = ${function:Db.Create}
    update  = ${function:Db.Update}
    destroy = ${function:Db.Destroy}
}
```

Or, if no wrapping is needed at all, you might not need the controller object—the functions can be referenced directly. This minimizes redundancy and prevents the problems that come with extra layers of indirection.

## Why Favor First-Class Functions?

Eliminating unnecessary function wrappers reduces maintenance overhead. When functions are passed directly:
- There’s no confusion over argument naming.
- There’s less boilerplate code.
- Any change to the underlying function signature won’t require modifying redundant wrapper functions.

For example, consider a scenario where a function is called from an HTTP request:

```powershell
# Without first class functions, changes in argument structure force you to update wrappers:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://example.com/post/2" -Method Get -UseBasicParsing | 
    ForEach-Object { param($json) Render-Post $json }

# With proper usage of first class functions, you simply pass Render-Post directly:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://example.com/post/2" -Method Get -UseBasicParsing | 
    ForEach-Object Render-Post
```

This approach leads to more concise, readable, and maintainable code.

And with that, we’re ready to move on to the next chapter where we delve deeper into pure functions in PowerShell.
