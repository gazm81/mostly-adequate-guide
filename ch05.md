# Chapter 05: Coding by Composing

## Functional Husbandry

Below is a simple implementation of function composition in PowerShell. In JavaScript you might see a variadic compose function, but let’s start with a simple two‑function version. In PowerShell we can define a helper that composes two functions:

```powershell
function Compose2 {
    param(
        [ScriptBlock]$f,
        [ScriptBlock]$g
    )
    return {
        param($x)
        # Call $g with $x, then pass the result to $f.
        return & $f (& $g $x)
    }
}
```

For example, let’s define two simple functions:

```powershell
$toUpperCase = { param($x) $x.ToUpper() }
$exclaim     = { param($x) "$x!" }

# Compose them:
$shout = Compose2 -f $exclaim -g $toUpperCase

# Usage:
Write-Output (& $shout 'send in the clowns')  # Outputs: SEND IN THE CLOWNS!
```

The composition of two functions returns a new function. In our definition, the inner function ($g) is invoked first and its output is fed into the outer function ($f). This is akin to mathematically writing:  
  f ∘ g (x) = f(g(x)).

We can extend this idea to compose several functions. One simple strategy is to recursively compose functions from right to left. For example:

```powershell
function Compose {
    param(
        [ScriptBlock[]]$Functions
    )
    if ($Functions.Count -eq 0) {
        return { param($x) $x }  # identity function when no functions remain
    }
    elseif ($Functions.Count -eq 1) {
        return $Functions[0]
    }
    else {
        # Reduce the list by composing the last two, then repeating.
        $composed = Compose2 -f $Functions[0] -g $Functions[1]
        for ($i = 2; $i -lt $Functions.Count; $i++) {
            $composed = Compose2 -f $Functions[$i] -g $composed
        }
        return $composed
    }
}
```

Using this `Compose` function, we can compose any number of functions. Thanks to associativity, it doesn’t matter exactly how you group them.

For example, consider the following grouping:  
```powershell
$shout = Compose -Functions @($exclaim, $toUpperCase)
```

This is equivalent to:
```powershell
$shout = { param($x) & $exclaim (& $toUpperCase $x) }
```

Without composition, you might write:
```powershell
function Shout {
    param($x)
    return & $exclaim (& $toUpperCase $x)
}
```

But using composition we can build functions more “organically” by simply piping the output of one function to the next.

## Pointfree Style

Pointfree style means writing functions without explicitly mentioning the data. For example, instead of writing:

```powershell
function SnakeCase {
    param($word)
    return ($word.ToLower() -replace '\s+', '_')
}
```

we can pre-load helper functions to operate on the data. Assume we define a curried replace helper (using our earlier currying techniques):

```powershell
function CurryReplace {
    param(
        [string]$Pattern
    )
    return {
        param([string]$Replacement)
        return {
            param([string]$Input)
            return $Input -replace $Pattern, $Replacement
        }
    }
}

# Partially apply:
$noSpaces = CurryReplace -Pattern '\s+'       # Pre-load the pattern.
$snakeify = & $noSpaces '_'                     # Pre-load the replacement string.

# Now create a pointfree SnakeCase using composition:
$toLowerCase = { param($x) $x.ToLower() }
$SnakeCase = Compose -Functions @($snakeify, $toLowerCase)

# Usage:
Write-Output (& $SnakeCase 'Hello Functional World')  # Outputs: hello_functional_world
```

Notice how we never mention the input in our definition of `$SnakeCase`—it’s built entirely from smaller, specialized functions.

## Debugging Compositions

Sometimes compositions don’t work as expected. One can introduce a helper `Trace` function to log intermediate data:

```powershell
function Trace {
    param(
        [string]$Tag,
        $Value
    )
    Write-Output "$Tag: $Value"
    return $Value
}

# Example: insert Trace to check data flow.
$traceToLower = {
    param($x)
    & Trace -Tag "After toLowerCase" ($x)
    return $x
}

# Recompose with trace:
$dasherize = Compose -Functions @(
    { param($x) ($x -split '\s+' | -join '-') },  # simple intercalation with dashes
    $traceToLower,
    $toLowerCase
)

Write-Output (& $dasherize 'The world is a vampire')
# You will see the trace output as well as the final result.
```

Using `Trace`, you can inspect the data at specific points within your composition chain, which helps in debugging and understanding the flow of data.

## Category Theory and Identity

Category theory introduces a few key concepts:
  
- **Objects:** Think of data types (e.g. String, Number).
- **Morphisms:** These are your pure functions.
- **Composition:** Our `Compose` function illustrates how morphisms are composed. A crucial property here is associativity:
  
  ```powershell
  # In words:
  Compose -Functions @($f, (Compose -Functions @($g, $h))) `
      equals `
  Compose -Functions @( (Compose -Functions @($f, $g)), $h ).
  ```
  
- **Identity:** We define an identity function that returns its argument unchanged:
  
  ```powershell
  $id = { param($x) $x }
  
  # And it should satisfy:
  # Compose2($id, $f) and Compose2($f, $id) both yield $f.
  ```

This identity function is useful when transitioning to a pointfree style, or when a function is required but no transformation is needed.

## In Summary

Composition is a powerful tool that lets you build new functions by combining small, focused functions. By embracing composition—and its associated pointfree style—you reduce boilerplate, increase modularity, and keep your codebase both concise and expressive.

As we move ahead, you’ll see that these principles of composing functions, along with currying and other functional techniques, provide a strong foundation for building robust, testable PowerShell scripts.

Next up, we’ll see these concepts applied to an example application.

Chapter 06: Example Application

## Exercises

Below are several exercises reimagined in PowerShell. In each exercise, consider working with custom objects (for example, representing cars) with properties like `Name`, `Horsepower`, `DollarValue`, and `InStock`.

### Exercise A

Using `Compose`, rewrite the function below so that it retrieves the `InStock` property of the last car.

```powershell
# Initial approach:
function Get-LastInStock {
    param([Object[]]$Cars)
    $lastCar = $Cars[-1]
    return $lastCar.InStock
}
```

*Hint: Create helper functions for extracting the last element and for getting a property by name, then compose them.*

### Exercise B

Given the helper function:

```powershell
function Average {
    param([int[]]$Numbers)
    return ($Numbers | Measure-Object -Average).Average
}
```

Refactor the following function into a composition style:

```powershell
function AverageDollarValue {
    param([Object[]]$Cars)
    $dollarValues = $Cars | ForEach-Object { $_.DollarValue }
    return Average -Numbers $dollarValues
}
```

*Hint: Create a helper that maps objects to their `DollarValue` property and then compose it with `Average`.*

### Exercise C

Refactor `FastestCar` using composition and pointfree style. Initially, you might have:

```powershell
function FastestCar {
    param([Object[]]$Cars)
    $sorted = $Cars | Sort-Object -Property Horsepower
    $fastest = $sorted[-1]
    return "$($fastest.Name) is the fastest"
}
```

*Hint: Create small functions for sorting, retrieving the last element, extracting the name, and concatenating strings. Then use `Compose` to build the final function.*
